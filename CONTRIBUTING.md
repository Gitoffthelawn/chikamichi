## How to set up a Local Development Environment

First, clone the forked repository locally.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:foo/chikamichi.git
```

Install dependent modules with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/ja/).
If you do not have pnpm, please install it beforehand.

```bash
$ pnpm i
```

The dev command starts the development server.

```bash
$ pnpm run dev
```

When the development server starts, the Extension build results are output to the `extension`.

You can use extensions in your browser by loading the contents of the extensions folder in Chrome Exteinsions.
